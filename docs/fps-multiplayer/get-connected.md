## [Setting Up Photon](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-online-multiplayer/learn/lecture/25987962#questions)

- Install PUN2 from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922
- Before importing into our project, de-select the demo checkboxes
- Create an account here: https://www.photonengine.com/
- Create a new app and note the `app id`. This will be required as part of the PUN setup in Unity.
- Under `Assets/Photon/PhotonUnityNetworking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings`, change `Fixed Region` to `us`

## [Laying Out The Connection Menu](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-online-multiplayer/learn/lecture/25987964#questions)

- Create a new scene for the main menu and save it in the `scenes` folder as `main menu`.
- Set up the basic buttons for the menu by creating a UI canvas, renaming it to `menu canvas`, and adjusting the canvas settings to scale with screen size.
- Add a title text to the top of the canvas to display the name of the game.
- Create buttons for the menu system by adding UI button elements and customizing their appearance, size, and position.
- Convert the button into a prefab by dragging it into the prefabs folder. This allows for easy reuse of the button design in different scenes.
- Create additional buttons for different menu options such as `Find Room`, `Create Room`, and `Quit Game`. Customize the text and appearance of each button as needed.
- Organize the buttons using a Vertical Layout Group component in a parent object called `menu buttons`. Adjust the positioning and spacing of the buttons within the layout.
- Add a loading panel by creating a UI panel element. Customize the panel's appearance, size, and position to display loading information.
- Add loading text to the loading panel using a UI TextMeshPro element. Customize the text appearance and positioning.
- Import a 3D model of a city as a background for the menu scene. Adjust the position and rotation of the camera to create a visually appealing view.
- Save the scene and proceed to the next steps, which will involve connecting the menu buttons to the actual game functionality.

## [Connecting To The Server](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-online-multiplayer/learn/lecture/25987966#questions)

The speaker is explaining how to create a simple networking system for a game using Photon Unity Networking (PUN). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

- Create a new script called `Launcher` and open it in the script editor.
- Make the launcher a static instance (`public static Launcher instance`).
- In the `Awake()` function, assign the instance to `this`.
- Import Photon Unity Networking by adding `using Photon.Pun` at the top of the script.
- Replace `MonoBehaviour` with `MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks`.
- Add references for the loading screen, menu buttons, and loading text (Te√•xtMeshPro element).
- Create a void function called `CloseMenus()` to close any open menus.
- In the `Start()` function, close all menus, then set the loading screen active and update the loading text to say `Connecting to Network.`
- Connect to the Photon network using `PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings()`.
- Create a public override void function called `OnConnectedToMaster()`.
- In OnConnectedToMaster(), join the lobby using `PhotonNetwork.JoinLobby()` and update the loading text to say `Joining Lobby.`
- Remove the menu buttons activation code from `OnConnectedToMaster()` as it will be moved to another function.
- Create another override void function called `OnJoinedLobby()`.
- In `OnJoinedLobby()`, activate the menu buttons.

After completing these steps, you should have a basic networking system in place. When the game starts, it will display a loading screen with the text `Connecting to Network,` then briefly change to `Joining Lobby` before displaying the menu buttons. From this point, you can continue to implement creating and joining rooms for your game.

`Launcher.cs`

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using Unity.VisualScripting;
using TMPro;

public class Launcher : MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks
{
  public static Launcher instance;
  public GameObject loadingScreen;
  public TextMeshProUGUI loadingText;
  public GameObject menuButtons;

  private void Awake()
  {
    if (instance != null)
    {
      Destroy(gameObject);
      return;
    }
    instance = this;
    DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
  }

  // Start is called before the first frame update
  void Start()
  {
    CloseMenus();
    loadingScreen.SetActive(true);
    loadingText.text = "Connecting To Network...";

    PhotonNetwork.ConnectUsingSettings();
  }

  void CloseMenus()
  {
    loadingScreen.SetActive(false);
    menuButtons.SetActive(false);
  }

  public override void OnConnectedToMaster()
  {
    PhotonNetwork.JoinLobby();
    loadingText.text = "Joining Lobby...";
  }

  public override void OnJoinedLobby()
  {
    CloseMenus();
    menuButtons.SetActive(true);
  }
}
```
